    <h2> About Us</h2>
    <p class="para container">A doctor is a medical practitioner who conducts health check-ups and diagnoses any issues related to a person’s mental or physical health. Doctors are an integral part of the society. Doctors specialize in different fields to treat and cure different kinds of health problems. The field of medical science is vast and it takes years of education and rigorous training to get into this profession. On joining the profession a doctor takes an Oath to their integrity and to not involve in any kind of misbehaviour, illegal activities with their patients or with the society as a whole. A doctor is a saviour and s/he is the only hope for his/her patients. The society must respect the doctors for their services; on the other hand, doctors also must not unnecessary try to exploit their patients for monetary gains. 
    Doctors are considered to be one of the most important parts of the society. Having a hospital, nursing home or a doctor’s clinic nearby is one of the first things one sees while looking for a house. This is because having medical help nearby gives a sense of security.

Doctors specialize in various fields to provide specialized treatments to the patients. Some of these include anaesthesiologist, cardiologist, allergist, gynaecologist, immunologist, neonatologist, oncologist, radiologist, obstetrician, physiologist and paediatrician. Most people visit general physicians when faced with any medical issue. These doctors examine the patients and prescribe them medicine and also refer them to specialist doctors if they need.
