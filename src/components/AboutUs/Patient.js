    <h2> About Us</h2>
    <p class="para container">Caring for patients is somehow involving and it can be very tiring. One has to take extra care to protect him/her from exhaustion and especially due to lifting things and overworking. A man is a living being and has to rest every now and then both physically and emotionally. People can revive themselves from time to time to get rid of burnout and disorientation. In order to care for the patients more effectively, one has to care for him/herself, and not allow him/herself to get too exhausted. It is normal to feel exhausted and have burnout sometimes but feeling so all the time must be avoided because it is counter productive.

In order to take care of this problem, the first step is to identify it. Compassion fatigue can be caused by traumatic experiences in the line of work or too much work and too little rest. Physical and emotional exhaustion can make work impossible and leave one feeling hopeless and confused (Mathieu, 2012). This is why this phenomenon should be avoided at all costs by maintaining a healthy schedule and taking time to rest when one is not feeling well. Traumatic stress is most felt by caregivers because they meet more than one patient per day and they have to empathize with their patients all the time. It is normal to feel worn out and exhausted because of this and one can only hope to cope with the situation and get the best out of it by finding ways to combat burnout.

Traumatic stress can be caused by a number factors and the leading one is losing patients that one has grown emotionally attached to. The next step towards healing and protecting oneself is maintaining a professional distance and making sure that health care provider understands that some situations are out of their hands.

The only way caregiver can be effective in caring for others is by first caring for self. This is because one can only give what he/she has inside
